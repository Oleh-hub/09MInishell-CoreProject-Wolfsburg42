# 09Minishell-CoreProject-Wolfsburg42
This project is about creating a simple shell (command-line interpreter).
A kind of little bash mimic. A lot about processes and file descriptors should be learned in the process.
## Short description of the project
It is a team project for two. One is supposed to do the parsing part, another - the execution part.
## The minishell functionality in compairition with bash:
- The shell will work only in interactive mode (no scripts, i.e. the executable takes no arguments)
- Run simple commands with absolute, relative path (e.g. /bin/ls, ../bin/ls)
- Run simple commands without a path (e.g. ls, cat, grep, etcâ€¦)
